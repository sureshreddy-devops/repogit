Git Push Origin Master
Git push origin master is a special command-line utility that specifies the remote branch and directory. When you have multiple branches and directory, then this command assists you in determining your main branch and repository.

Generally, the term origin stands for the remote repository, and master is considered as the main branch. So, the entire statement "git push origin master" pushed the local content on the master branch of the remote location.
